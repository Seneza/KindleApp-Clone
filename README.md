# KindleApp-Clone

Kindle App clone is a small project I started, just to teach myself the benefits of doing things programmatically in XCode without using storyboard. I intend to continue exploring what this side project can help me learn and help others learn iOS development with me. YOu are welcome to contribute to this project. Ideas shared can help thousands of people lead a better life. I will keep updating this project as I go, and hoping that you find it interesting enough to pull requests.
