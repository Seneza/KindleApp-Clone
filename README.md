# KindleApp-Clone

Kindle App clone is a small project I started, just to teach myself the benefits of doing things programmatically in XCode without using storyboard. I intend to continue exploring what this side project can help me learn and help others learn iOS development with me. YOu are welcome to contribute to this project. Ideas shared can help thousands of people lead a better life. I will keep updating this project as I go, and hoping that you find it interesting enough to pull requests.

DOing AutoLayout in programmatically can be intimidating at first, but it is really fun once you ge the hang of it! It makes collaboration on version control so much easier and gives you the power to own the dev process, change things as easy as changing lines of code as you go.
